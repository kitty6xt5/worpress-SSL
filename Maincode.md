# CREATING A WORDPRESS WEBSITE AND GIVING IT A SSL CERTIFICATE
### To create this - we are going to use the lamp stack
## LAMP Stack
The LAMP stack is a popular open-source solution stack used primarily for web development.<v>
 Here, LAMP stands for Linux, Apache MySQL, PHP, and Perl. It consists of 4 components for a fully functional web development environment.

## Linux: 
 Linux is the first layer. Linux is the foundation of the stack model and for all other layers. Linux is free and also it is open source os.

## Apache: 

 This is the second layer.This layer provides web server software.Web servers translate web browsers to the correct website.<v> 
 Apacheâ€™s web server processes requests and delivers web assets via HTTP on port 80 to make the application accessible through a simple URL to everyone in the public domain.

## MySQL: 
 This is the third layer where databases reside. MySQL is an open-source relational database management software for storing application data.<v> 
 MySQL stores information that can be accessed by scripting to build a website.<v> 
 MySQL can be offloaded to a separate host server in high-end configurations.

## PHP: 
the fourth and final layer is PHP. PHP is an open-source scripting language that Apache can use to create dynamic web pages.<v> 
The scripting layer is made up of PHP or similar web programming languages. This layer hosts websites and web applications.

# So, Lets start our Task....
## STEP 1 : 
## FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE TO CREATE AN INSTANCE OF UBUNTU IMAGE AMI.


Launch the instance and connect it through ssh on terminal.

```
ssh -i "your key" ubuntu@(your publicip).compute-1.amazonaws.com
```

After connecting the instance, type -
```
sudo apt update
```
## STEP 2 : 
## INSTALL APACHE2
To install apache2 type-

```
sudo apt install apache2 -y

```
Enable the apache services-

```
sudo systemctl enable apache2

```
## Copy the public ip of that instance and paste it on web browser to check if its working or not.

## STEP 3 :
## INSTALL MY SQL
To install mysql run the following command-
```
sudo apt install mysql-server -y

```
Enable MySQL-

```
sudo systemctl enable mysql

```
## STEP 4 :
## INSTALL PHP
WordPress is a PHP-based CMS.<v>
Ubuntu 20.04 defaults to PHP 7.4 so,
To install php type-
```
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql -y

```
WordPress and many plugins use PHP extensions, which you will need to install manually.

```
 sudo apt install php-curl php-gd php-mbstring php-xml php-xmlrpc php-soap php-intl php-zip -y

```
To verify that PHP 7.4 has been successfully installed type:

```
php -v

```
Restart apache2 service
```
sudo systemctl restart apache2

```
## STEP 5 :
## Install WordPress
Once we have set our LAMP environment, nOW we can begin installing WordPress.<V>
We will download the WordPress installation files and place them in the default web server root directory of /var/www/html. for this type-
Change the directory ,type-
```
cd /var/www/html

```
Download the latest WordPress install with the following command.

```
sudo wget -c http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz

```
Extract the files-

```

 sudo tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz

```

The extracted WordPress files will now be placed in the WordPress directory at the given location.

```
/var/www/html/wordpress

````

The user of your web server must own these files.

We are using Apache as our web server. Apache is running on Ubuntu 20.04.<v>
The following command will allow you to change the owner of these files and set the appropriate permissions:

```
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/wordpress

```

## STEP 6:
## CREATE A DATABASE FOR WORDPRESS

Now we will create a WordPress database. 
Log in to your MySQL root account via Terminal by entering:

```
 sudo mysql -u root

```

Create a separate database for WordPress to manage data-
type,
```

CREATE DATABASE (your_databasename);

```

To access the new database, we will create a MySQL user account.
type- 

```
CREATE USER (your_username)@localhost IDENTIFIED BY '(your_password)';

```

New user created.
Give privileges to your user,type-

```
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON (database_name). * TO (your_username)@localhost;

```

After completing the above, flush your privileges to allow MySQL to implement the changes.

```

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

```
type exit
```
exit;

```

Allow the executable permission to be granted to WordPress folder.

```
sudo chmod -R 777 wordpress

```

Now, type-

```
cd wordpress

```

## STEP 7: 
## SETUP AND CONFIGURING OF WORDPRESS
After setting up a database for WordPress, The final step is to set up and configure WordPress.<v>
Re need to create a configuration file for WordPress.<v>
Rename the sample WordPress configuration file using the following command:

```

mv wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php

```

To Edit the wpconfig file type-

```

sudo vim wp-config.php

```

Update the database settings by replacing your_databasename, your_user, and your_password with your own details.

Save the file and close it.

Once you have done this, you can access your WordPress page to finish the installation.<v>
Open the browser and go to-

```
http://(your-ip-address)/wordpress/wp-admin/install.php

```
The next screen will open. Click on Continue and select the language.
After that you can check if its working or not.

```
http://(your-ip-address)/wordpress/

```

## STEP 8 :
## PROVIDING SSL CERTIFICATE TO WORDPRESS WEBSITE.
Now we will provide ssl certificate to wordpress website..

### Install snapd
You'll need to install snapd and make sure you follow any instructions to enable classic snap support

```
sudo apt install snapd

```

### Remove certbot-auto and any Certbot OS packages
If you have any Certbot packages installed using an OS package manager like apt, dnf, or yum, you should remove them before installing the Certbot snap to ensure that when you run the command certbot the snap is used rather than the installation from your OS package manager.<v> The exact command to do this depends on your OS, but common examples are sudo apt-get remove certbot, 

```
sudo apt-get remove certbot

```
then,
 
 ```

sudo apt-get purge certbot

```
then,


```

sudo apt-get autoremove

```

### Install Certbot
Run this command on the command line on the machine to install Certbot.

```

sudo snap install --classic certbot

```

### Prepare the Certbot command
Execute the following instruction on the command line on the machine to ensure that the certbot command can be run.

```

sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot

```

### Choose how you'd like to run Certbot
### Either get and install your certificates...
Run this command to get a certificate and have Certbot edit your apache configuration automatically to serve it, turning on HTTPS access in a single step.

```

sudo certbot --apache

```

### Or, just get a certificate
If you're feeling more conservative and would like to make the changes to your apache configuration by hand, run this command.

```
sudo certbot certonly --apache

```

### Test automatic renewal
The Certbot packages on your system come with a cron job or systemd timer that will renew your certificates automatically before they expire.<v> You will not need to run Certbot again, unless you change your configuration.<v> You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this command:

```

sudo certbot renew --dry-run

```

The command to renew certbot is installed in one of the following locations:

```

/etc/crontab/
/etc/cron.*/*
systemctl list-timers

```

### Confirm that Certbot worked
To confirm that your site is set up properly, visit ``` https://yourwebsite.com/ ``` in your browser and look for the lock icon in the URL bar.
